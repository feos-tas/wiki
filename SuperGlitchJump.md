In the game it is possible to super jump (for player 1).
To do it you must pick up player 1 by player 2.
Next, the player 2 must throw player 1 at the same time when something attacking him  (no matter what).

It can be done by other way, but it can be a little more difficult.
Namely, 2 players have to perform similar actions, primarily attacks at the same time. Please take a look at the link below, this movie shows that glitch:
